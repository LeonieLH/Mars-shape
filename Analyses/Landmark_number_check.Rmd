#This little loop scans checkpoint landmarking files and makes sure that the NumberOfPoints line has 58 landmarks listed (as opposed to a different number). It throws an error if not the case.

```{r}

library(rstudioapi)
setwd(dirname(getActiveDocumentContext()$path))

filelist <- list.files(path = "../Data/Raw/chkpt_stl_files_for_checking")

NOP_check <- vector()

for (i in 1:length(filelist)){
  temp <- filelist[i]
  
  NOP_check [i] <- grep("NumberOfPoints: 58", readLines( paste("../Data/Raw/chkpt_stl_files_for_checking/", temp, sep = "") ))
  
}
